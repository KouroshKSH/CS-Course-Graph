# CS-Course-Graph
This repository is for creating an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) graph that connects the [Computer Science](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) courses offered at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/). The project is a combination of a web scraper written by [Arya Hassibi](https://github.com/aryahassibi), and a script for creating markdown notes by me.
